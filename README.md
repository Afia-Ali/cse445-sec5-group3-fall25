Goal - The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning–based autonomous driving system that enables a vehicle to navigate without human intervention. The system is designed using a modular approach, where different components work together to understand the driving environment and make navigation decisions.

Lane detection - Implementation of road lane detection using a lightweight YOLOv8n model for real-time performance.

Obstacle detection - Detection of moving vehicles surrounding the car in order to improve situational awareness and safety.

Turn prediction - A decision-making module using YOLOv8n that determines whether the vehicle should move forward, turn left, or turn right based on detected lanes and objects.
Custom datasets created using Roboflow to improve detection accuracy for training. To evaluate the system’s performance under controlled conditions and identify limitations.
